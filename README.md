Introduction

This project presents solutions to Python Task - 2, implementing fundamental programming concepts in Python, including loops, functions, mathematical computations, recursion, and graph traversal algorithms.

Each solution is designed to be efficient, user-friendly, and follows best coding practices.

Implementation Details
9.Prime Number
Objective: Determine if a number is prime.
Approach: Check divisibility up to 
𝑛
n
​to optimize performance.

10.Sum of Digits

Objective: Calculate the sum of all digits in a given number.
Approach: Convert number to a string, iterate through each digit, and sum up values.

11.LCM and GCD

Objective: Compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
Approach: Use Python’s math.gcd() function and apply the formula:
LCM
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
=
∣
𝑎
×
𝑏
∣
GCD
(
𝑎
,
𝑏
)
LCM(a,b)= 
GCD(a,b)
∣a×b∣
​
 

12.List Reversal

Objective: Reverse a list without using built-in functions.
Approach: Iterate from the last index to the first and construct the reversed list.

13.Sort a List

Objective: Sort a list in ascending order without using built-in sorting methods.
Approach: Implement Bubble Sort, an intuitive sorting algorithm.

14.Remove Duplicates

Objective: Remove duplicate elements from a list.
Approach: Use a set to filter out unique elements.

15.String Length (Without len())

Objective: Compute the length of a string without using len().

16.Count Vowels and Consonants

Objective: Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

2.Maze Generator and Solver

Objective: Generate and solve a random maze using DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search).

Challenges

Implementing efficient sorting and graph traversal algorithms.
Ensuring maze solvability using DFS and BFS.
Handling edge cases such as empty inputs and negative numbers.
